                        <h1>What Metrics Measure App User Engagement?</h1>

                        <img src="img/app-metrics2.png" alt="Acquisition, Engagement, and Outcomes diagram" class="img-responsive" width="50%" style="float:right">
                        <p>We now know that measuring and optimizing engagement is essential to keeping users. Now it’s time to identify which analytics metrics to monitor.</p>

                        
                        <p>Metrics are numerical values that track the number of times a certain behavior occurs.  
                        Determining data points that are the most actionable for tracking user engagement can be difficult and largely depends on business goals, app vertical, and tools used. However, listed below are useful measures for assessing user engagement. Keep in mind that specific tools have their own unique names for the actions they track. </p>

                        <h2>Events</h2>
                        <p>Events are very specific to your vertical and describe custom actions that take place within your app. For example, a gaming app might track “Level achieved” or an eCommerce app might track “Add to cart.”</p>

                        <p>Most app analytics tools also allow you to add context to events with attributes, so for the above game and eCommerce examples, you might add the name of the level achieved or the name of the item that was added to the cart.</p>

                        <h2>User Flow</h2>
                        <p>Tracking user flow is achieved by monitoring the user’s screen navigation, that is what path they take within your app once they start a session. Think of it as a step-by-step diagram of how a user navigates your app. Evaluating user flow allows you to identify points of friction in your funnels.</p>

                        <h2>Drop Off</h2>
                        <p>Analyze when users become disengaged with your app by assessing where they drop off within your app. This is a great metric to identify major technical or design issues. For example, if you have a game and notice a significant amount of users dropping off at a particular screen, you can offer the user help or redesign the level. </p>

                        <h2>Loyalty and Retention</h2>
                        <p>Loyalty and retention tracks the number of users that are still active after a certain period of days. In order to understand if tweaks and redesigns are meeting user needs, tracking this metric along with user segments will allow you to measure the effect optimization efforts have on user loyalty.</p>

                        <h2>Session Lengths</h2>
                        <p>A session is a distinct period of user interaction within your app. It encompasses the time between an app open and close or session timeout. Tracking session length by cohort can help you identify which audiences are spending the least amount of time in your app and investigate why.</p>

                        <p>You can also see where users are spending the majority of their time while using your app and use it to develop content decisions. For instance, if you notice that a specific piece of content has a high session length, you can continue creating similar content that appeals to your users.</p>

                        <h2>Top Screens</h2>
                        <p>Monitor total views to evaluate which screens are the most popular. If users are navigating to a screen that’s outside of a conversion funnel, perhaps there’s a better way to present the information to keep them on the desired path.</p>

                        <h1>Compare Your Users</h1>
                        
                        <h2>Segments</h2>

                         <img src="img/users.png" alt="Acquisition, Engagement, and Outcomes diagram" class="img-responsive" width="20%" style="float:right">

                        <p>Segments are groups of users that share common characteristics with one another such as operating system, in-app actions, or acquisition source.</p>

                        <p>Understanding how groups of users differ from one another by identifying different usage patterns can provide valuable insight. For instance, you may notice that tablet users spend more time on a particular screen than smartphone users, which may suggest that your tablet app needs to be redesigned.</p>

                        <p>In addition to informing redesigns, identifying groups of users who interact with a certain aspect of your app in a similar way makes it easier to engage users through personalization.</p>
